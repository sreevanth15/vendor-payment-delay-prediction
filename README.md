# Vendor Payment Delay Prediction

## Project Overview

This project implements a predictive model to classify whether upcoming vendor payments will be "On-time" or "Delayed" based on historical payment data and various financial metrics.

## Problem Statement

Late payments to vendors can:
- Disrupt supply chains
- Increase costs through penalties or loss of discounts
- Damage vendor relationships
- Impact business operations

## System Objectives

This comprehensive vendor payment prediction system is designed to:

### 🏢 **Data Infrastructure**
- **Provide a centralized vendor payment data warehouse** for efficient storage, integration, and retrieval of payment-related information across the organization
- **Enable seamless data integration** from multiple sources including ERP systems, accounting software, and vendor management platforms

### 🔮 **Predictive Analytics**
- **Enable predictive modeling** to forecast which vendors or invoices are at risk of late payment
- **Implement risk scoring algorithms** that continuously assess payment likelihood based on historical patterns and current conditions
- **Provide early warning systems** with configurable alert thresholds for proactive intervention

### 📊 **Business Intelligence & Reporting**
- **Generate analytical reports and dashboards** for managers to track payment patterns, delays, and associated risks
- **Deliver real-time visibility** into payment pipeline health and vendor performance metrics
- **Enable drill-down analysis** from high-level trends to individual transaction details

### 💰 **Financial Optimization**
- **Support decision-making** by identifying cost-saving opportunities (e.g., capturing early-payment discounts, reducing penalties)
- **Optimize cash flow management** through better payment timing predictions and scheduling
- **Quantify financial impact** of payment delays and improvement opportunities

### 🤝 **Vendor Relationship Management**
- **Ultimately improve vendor trust** through more reliable and predictable payment processes
- **Enable proactive communication** with at-risk vendors before payment issues arise
- **Support strategic vendor negotiations** with data-driven insights on payment patterns

## Solution Approach

We use machine learning techniques to predict payment delays before they occur, enabling proactive management of vendor relationships and cash flow.

## Data Mining Techniques Used

1. **Logistic Regression**: Baseline classification model for interpretable results
2. **Random Forest**: Handles non-linear relationships and feature interactions
3. **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**: High accuracy with hyperparameter tuning
